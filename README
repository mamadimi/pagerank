Implementation of pagerank algorithm in multithread enviroment.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank

In a graph, based on the posibillity to move from node A to node B, a pagerank posibillity is calculated.
This, indicates how important is the node.
Nodes with high value is more possible to be visited, so they are more important.

It's a way to sort pages in the web. Google used to use this algorithm to sort pages.
